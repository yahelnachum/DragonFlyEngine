Our team name is "Macaroni & Cheese at IHOP"

The game will be called IHOP Simulator October 2015

The closest genre our game will fit is the maze game genre.

The game will be like packman with added challenges, where the player must reach certain locations in order to stack blocks on top of each other, open doors to reach new areas, and gain various powerups to help them stay alive and gain points. That is at least the idea right now.

Techinical challenges will be designing  a path for the player to walk, like how pac man has walls. Also, designing the enemy AI to be difficult, but counterable will be another challenge. 

Significant artistic aspects will be making the player understand what each of the objects are. The blocks, enemies, and main character must all be clearly identifiable, and understandable. The enemies wil be one to 2 characters tall, and 1 character wide. the blocks will be 1 character tall, and 4 characters wide. The main player will be at most 5 characters by 5 characters.
